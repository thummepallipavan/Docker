What is a Bind Mount:-

A bind mount is another type of mount, which lets you share a directory from the host's filesystem into the container. When working on an application, you can use a bind mount to mount source code into the container. The container sees the changes you make to the code immediately, as soon as you save a file. This means that you can run processes in the container that watch for filesystem changes and respond to them

Steps for the hands on Exercise:-

-> Create a folder by name <bindmount>
          command :- mkdir bindmount
-> Change the directory to bindmount
          command :- cd bindmount
-> create a index.html file and copy the code 
           command :- vi index.html
-> Create a conatiner with bind mount volume 
           command:-  sudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /home/ubuntu/bindmount:/usr/share/nginx/html --name webserver nginx
-> Copy the ip address of the server and paste the follwing in the browser <ip address>:8080
-> You will see a web page
-> Now make changes to file index.html
            -> line no 39, you are learning Devops
-> Refresh the webpage now you should be able to see the changes

Note:-
To copy the contents from the current Directory:-
sudo docker run -d -p 8084:80 -v "$(pwd)":/usr/share/nginx/html --name webserver5 nginx
