Practice Exercises
Exercise 1: Creating and Inspecting a Docker Bridge Network

Create a new bridge network named my-bridge-network.
Run two containers (container1 and container2), and connect them to my-bridge-network.
Inspect my-bridge-network to see the containers attached to it.
Exercise 2: Communication Between Containers

Execute a command in container1 to install ping (if not already present).
Use ping from container1 to container2 using its IP address (obtained from network inspection) to test connectivity.
